**Project Title: County-Wise Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Analysis in Texas Using Tableau**

**Project Description:**
This project analyzes Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) across different counties in Texas using Tableau. The focus is on Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) and the number of device days for each county. Data clustering techniques are used to categorize counties based on the number of device days, with insights into high-risk areas.
I have used tableau to create dashboard and i have uploaded an analysis document.
